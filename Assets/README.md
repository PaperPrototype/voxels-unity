Layout:

The "Ignore" folder contains project at each stage of the course.

The "Quad" folder is the Quad project from section 01 in the course.

The "Voxel" folder is the Voxel project from section 02 in the course.

The "Chunk" folder is the result of sections 03 to 09. I first made all the project in the "Ignore" folder, then I would go back and make the lecture while following along and updating the code in the Chunk.cs script. This way I put myself in the seat of the student, and could make sure to find any mistakes or gotchas the student might also stumble upon.
